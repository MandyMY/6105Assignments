## assignment-1-MandyMY

This assignment used Exploratory Data Analysis to find factors affecting a country's GDP per capita in order to make a predictive model of countries GDP. It filled most of the missing datas in the datasets by the median of the region that a country belongs, and observed correlations of different factors by plotting using seeborn, finally, got the linear relationship between GDP per capita and factors which has high correlation with GDP per capita by linear regression. After researching the data sets from The World Factbook, it can be certified that independent variables Phones (per 1000) and Service have strong linear relation to GDP ($ per capita), the predictive model of countries GDP have been made using linear regression.  
This assignment is based on Kaggle Kernel https://www.kaggle.com/stieranka/predicting-gdp-world-countries.

## assignment-2-MandyMY

This Assignment is about Linear Models, its analyzes base on the dataset from Lianjia, a major local estate agency in China. In Part A, I built a Simple Regression Model between the square and the total price of a house, and a Multiple Regression Model between the square of a house and the number of different rooms. In Part B, I built a Simple Logistic Model between the house's followers and whether a subway station is near the house, and a Multivariable Logistic Model about house price and subway in different directions in Beijing. In Part C, there are some extensions on Part A's model. And Part D, I gave two pairs of terms which have synergy effect with each other.
